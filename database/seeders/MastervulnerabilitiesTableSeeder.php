                <p>A lower bound on the number of valid session identifiers that are available to be guessed is the
                number of users that are active on a site at any given moment. However, any users that abandon
                their sessions without logging out will increase this number. (This is one of many good reasons to
                have a short inactive session timeout.) With a 64 bit session identifier, assume 32 bits of entropy.
                For a large web site, assume that the attacker can try 1,000 guesses per second and that there
                are 10,000 valid session identifiers at any given moment. Given these assumptions, the expected
                time for an attacker to successfully guess a valid session identifier is less than 4 minutes. Now
                assume a 128 bit session identifier that provides 64 bits of entropy. With a very large web site, an
                attacker might try 10,000 guesses per second with 100,000 valid session identifiers available to
                be guessed. Given these assumptions, the expected time for an attacker to successfully guess a
                valid session identifier is greater than 292 years.

                lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases,
                and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may
                be obtained indirectly through API calls.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Strategy = Input Validation</p>
                <p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use
                a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not
                strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing
                input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the
                full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related
                fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input
                is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on looking for
                malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if
                the code`s environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended
                validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which
                inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</p>
                <p>Effectiveness = High</p>
                <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                <p>For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are
                duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side
                checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client
                to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to
                the server. Even though client-side checks provide minimal benefits with respect to serverside security, they are still useful. First, they can support intrusion detection. If the server
                receives input that should have been rejected by the client, then it may be an indication of an
                attack. Second, client-side error-checking can provide helpful feedback to the user about the
                expectations for valid input. Third, there may be a reduction in server-side processing time for
                accidental input errors, although this is typically a small savings.
                </p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>When your application combines data from multiple sources, perform the validation after the
                sources have been combined. The individual data elements may pass the validation step but
                violate the intended restrictions after they have been combined.
                </p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Be especially careful to validate all input when invoking code that crosses language boundaries,
                such as from an interpreted language to native code. This could create an unexpected interaction
                between the language boundaries. Ensure that you are not violating any of the expectations
                of the language with which you are interfacing. For example, even though Java may not be
                susceptible to buffer overflows, providing a large argument in a call to native code might trigger
                an overflow</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Directly convert your input type into the expected data type, such as using a conversion function
                that translates a string into a number. After converting to the expected data type, ensure that the
                input`s values fall within the expected range of allowable values and that multi-field consistencies
                are maintained.
                </p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application`s current internal representation
                before being validated (CWE-180, CWE-181). Make sure that your application does not
                inadvertently decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass
                allowlist schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked. Use
                libraries such as the OWASP ESAPI Canonicalization control. Consider performing repeated
                canonicalization until your input does not change any more. This will avoid double-decoding and
                similar scenarios, but it might inadvertently modify inputs that are allowed to contain properlyencoded dangerous content.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>When exchanging data between components, ensure that both components are using the same
                character encoding. Ensure that the proper encoding is applied at each interface. Explicitly set
                the encoding you are using whenever the protocol allows you to do so.</p>',

                single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory
                separators such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help
                to avoid CWE-434. Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially
                dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For
                example, filtering "/" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a
                directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that
                still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the
                ".../...//" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original
                string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.</p>

                effectively removes ".." sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59). This includes:
                realpath() in C getCanonicalPath() in Java GetFullPath() in ASP.NET realpath() or abs_path() in

                <p>Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial
                in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an
                emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are

                <p>An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques
                might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can
                still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an
                application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual
                effort may be required for customization.

                [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a

                rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as
                the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.</p>
                <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>

                <p>When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a
                mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs,
                and reject all other inputs. For example, ID 1 could map to "inbox.txt" and ID 2 could map to
                "profile.txt". Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap [REF-185] provide this capability.</p>

                <b>Phase: Operation</b>
                <p>Strategy = Sandbox or Jail</p>
                <p>Run the code in a "jail" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between
                the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed
                in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software. OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide
                some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the
                software to specify restrictions on file operations. This may not be a feasible solution, and it
                only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to
                compromise. Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.</p>
                <p>Effectiveness = Limited</p>
                <p>The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific
                sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as
                restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be
                accessed.</p>

                <b>Phase: Operation</b>
                <p>Strategy = Attack Surface Reduction</p>
                <p>Store library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise,
                store them in a separate directory and use the web server`s access control capabilities to prevent
                attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in
                each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the
                constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately. This
                significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms
                that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience
                and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which
                can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages
                should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed
                information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.
                If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what
                could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such
                as passwords should never be saved to log files. Avoid inconsistent messaging that might
                accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or
                not. In the context of path traversal, error messages which disclose path information can help
                attackers craft the appropriate attack strings to move through the file system hierarchy.</p>

                full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related
                fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may
                be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if
                the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on
                looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input,
                especially if the code`s environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass
                the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or
                determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When validating
                filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a
                single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory
                separators such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help
                to avoid CWE-434. Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially
                dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For
                example, filtering "/" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a
                directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that
                still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the
                ".../...//" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original
                string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.

                dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For

                still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the

                string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.

                Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.</p>
                <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                <p>For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are
                duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side
                checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to
                remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the
                server.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Strategy = Input Validation</p>
                <p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use
                a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not
                strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing
                input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the
                full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related
                fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may
                be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on
                looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input,
                especially if the code`s environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass
                the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or
                determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When validating
                filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a
                single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory
                separators such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help
                to avoid CWE-434. Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially
                dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For
                example, filtering "/" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a
                directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that
                still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the
                ".../...//" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original
                string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.</p>

                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical
                version of the pathname, which effectively removes ".." sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23,
                CWE-59).</p>

                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>If you are using PHP, configure your application so that it does not use register_globals. During
                implementation, develop your application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary
                of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as CWE-95,
                CWE-621, and similar issues.</p>
                <b>Phase: Testing</b>
                <p>Use tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing,
                threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.
                These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with
                weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.</p>',

                include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide
                some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the
                software to specify restrictions on file operations. This may not be a feasible solution, and it
                only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to
                compromise. Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.

                <p>Effectiveness = Limited</p>
                <p>The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific
                sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as
                restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be
                accessed.</p>
                <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                <p>Strategy = Attack Surface Reduction</p>
                <p>For any data that will be used to generate a command to be executed, keep as much of that data
                out of external control as possible. For example, in web applications, this may require storing the
                data locally in the session`s state instead of sending it out to the client in a hidden form field.</p>
                <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                <p>For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are
                duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side
                checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to
                remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the

                <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                <p>Strategy = Libraries or Frameworks</p>
                <p>Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides
                constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, consider using the
                ESAPI Encoding control [REF-45] or a similar tool, library, or framework. These will help the
                programmer encode outputs in a manner less prone to error.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Strategy = Output Encoding</p>
                <p>While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control
                and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape
                any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or
                filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not
                alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space,
                wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection
                (CWE-88).</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>If the program to be executed allows arguments to be specified within an input file or from
                standard input, then consider using that mode to pass arguments instead of the command line.</p>
                <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                <p>Strategy = Parameterization</p>
                <p>If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between
                data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding,
                and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at
                every point where output is generated. Some languages offer multiple functions that can be
                used to invoke commands. Where possible, identify any function that invokes a command shell
                using a single string, and replace it with a function that requires individual arguments. These functions typically perform appropriate quoting and filtering of arguments. For example, in C, the
                system() function accepts a string that contains the entire command to be executed, whereas
                execl(), execve(), and others require an array of strings, one for each argument. In Windows,
                CreateProcess() only accepts one command at a time. In Perl, if system() is provided with an
                array of arguments, then it will quote each of the arguments.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Strategy = Input Validation</p>
                <p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use
                a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not
                strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing
                input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the
                full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related
                fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be
                syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input
                is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on looking for
                malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if
                the code`s environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended
                validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining
                which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When constructing OS
                command strings, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected
                value of the parameter in the request. This will indirectly limit the scope of an attack, but this
                technique is less important than proper output encoding and escaping. Note that proper output
                encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing OS command
                injection, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it
                effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent OS command
                injection, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary
                characters. For example, when invoking a mail program, you might need to allow the subject
                field to contain otherwise-dangerous inputs like ";" and ">" characters, which would need to
                be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the character might reduce the risk
                of OS command injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the subject field
                would not be recorded as the user intended. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience,
                but it could be more important when the program relies on well-structured subject lines in order
                to pass messages to other components. Even if you make a mistake in your validation (such
                as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from
                injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input validation is still a useful
                technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow you to detect some attacks,
                and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not address.</p>

                <p>Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience
                and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which
                can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages
                should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed
                information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.
                If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what
                could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such
                as passwords should never be saved to log files. Avoid inconsistent messaging that might
                accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.
                In the context of OS Command Injection, error information passed back to the user might reveal
                whether an OS command is being executed and possibly which command is being used.</p>

                This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when
                generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or
                multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations
                to determine the required encoding strategies. For any data that will be output to another web
                page, especially any data that was received from external inputs, use the appropriate encoding
                on all non-alphanumeric characters. Parts of the same output document may require different
                encodings, which will vary depending on whether the output is in the: HTML body Element
                attributes (such as src="XYZ") URIs JavaScript sections Cascading Style Sheets and style
                property etc. Note that HTML Entity Encoding is only appropriate for the HTML body. Consult the

                <p>This technique has limited effectiveness, but can be helpful when it is possible to store client

                remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the

                <p>If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between
                data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and
                validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every
                point where output is generated.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Strategy = Output Encoding</p>
                <p>Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that
                is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an
                encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either
                by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which
                can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might
                treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original
                encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks;
                they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is
                also being used by the downstream component. The problem of inconsistent output encodings
                often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header, web browsers
                often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS
                attacks</p>

                <p>To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user`s session cookie, set the session cookie to be
                HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet
                Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user`s session cookie from being accessible
                to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since
                HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly, XMLHTTPRequest and other
                powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie
                header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.

                <p>Effectiveness = Defense in Depth</p>
                <p>Strategy = Input Validation
                </p>
                <p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use
                a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not
                strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing
                input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the
                full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related
                fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be
                syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input
                is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on looking for
                malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if
                the code`s environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended
                validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which
                inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When dynamically constructing
                web pages, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the
                parameter in the request. All input should be validated and cleansed, not just parameters that the
                user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers,
                the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is
                to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. It is common to see data
                from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development
                team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future
                developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended. Note that
                proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing XSS,
                although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits
                what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent XSS, especially if you are
                required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example,
                in a chat application, the heart emoticon ("<3") would likely pass the validation step, since it is
                commonly used. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the web page because it contains
                the "<" character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping
                the "<" might reduce the risk of XSS, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the
                emoticon would not be recorded. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience, but it would be
                more important in a mathematical forum that wants to represent inequalities. Even if you make a
                mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is
                still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input
                validation is still a useful technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow
                you to detect some attacks, and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not
                address. Ensure that you perform input validation at well-defined interfaces within the application.
                This will help protect the application even if a component is reused or moved elsewhere.</p>

                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Strategy = Input Validation</p>
                <p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use
                a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not
                strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing
                input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the
                full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related
                fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be
                syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input
                is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on looking for
                malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if
                the code`s environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended
                validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which
                inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Directly convert your input type into the expected data type, such as using a conversion function
                that translates a string into a number. After converting to the expected data type, ensure that the
                input`s values fall within the expected range of allowable values and that multi-field consistencies
                are maintained.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application`s current internal representation
                before being validated (CWE-180, CWE-181). Make sure that your application does not
                inadvertently decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass
                allowlist schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked. Use
                libraries such as the OWASP ESAPI Canonicalization control. Consider performing repeated
                canonicalization until your input does not change any more. This will avoid double-decoding and
                similar scenarios, but it might inadvertently modify inputs that are allowed to contain properlyencoded dangerous content.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>When exchanging data between components, ensure that both components are using the same
                character encoding. Ensure that the proper encoding is applied at each interface. Explicitly set
                the encoding you are using whenever the protocol allows you to do so.

                <p>When your application combines data from multiple sources, perform the validation after the
                sources have been combined. The individual data elements may pass the validation step but

                rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as
                the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations. Specifically, follow the principle
                of least privilege when creating user accounts to a SQL database. The database users should
                only have the minimum privileges necessary to use their account. If the requirements of the

                <p>While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control
                and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape
                any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape
                or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is
                not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white
                space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument
                injection (CWE-88). Instead of building a new implementation, such features may be available
                in the database or programming language. For example, the Oracle DBMS_ASSERT package
                can check or enforce that parameters have certain properties that make them less vulnerable to SQL injection. For MySQL, the mysql_real_escape_string() API function is available in both C
                and PHP.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Strategy = Input Validation</p>
                <p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use
                a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not
                strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing
                input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the
                full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related
                fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be
                syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input
                is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on looking for
                malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if
                the code`s environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended
                validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which
                inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When constructing SQL query
                strings, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the
                parameter in the request. This will indirectly limit the scope of an attack, but this technique is
                less important than proper output encoding and escaping. Note that proper output encoding,
                escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing SQL injection, although input
                validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will
                appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent SQL injection, especially if you are
                required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example,
                the name "O`Reilly" would likely pass the validation step, since it is a common last name in the
                English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains
                the "`" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this
                case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce
                incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded. When feasible, it may be safest
                to disallow meta-characters entirely, instead of escaping them. This will provide some defense in
                depth. After the data is entered into the database, later processes may neglect to escape metacharacters before use, and you may not have control over those processes.</p>
                <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                <p>Strategy = Enforcement by Conversion
                </p>
                <p>When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a
                mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs,
                and reject all other inputs.</p>
                <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                <p>Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience
                and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which
                can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages
                should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed
                information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.
                If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what
                could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such
                as passwords should never be saved to log files. Avoid inconsistent messaging that might
                accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.
                In the context of SQL Injection, error messages revealing the structure of a SQL query can help
                attackers tailor successful attack strings.
                </p>
                <b>Phase: Operation</b>
                <p>Strategy = Firewall</p>
                <p>Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial
                in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an
                emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are
                applied, or to provide defense in depth.</p>
                <p>Effectiveness = Moderate
                </p>
                <p>An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques
                might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can
                still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an
                application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual
                effort may be required for customization.

                <p>When using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During
                implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of
                implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as CWE-95,
                CWE-621, and similar issues.</p>',

                <p>Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application`s current internal representation
                before being validated (CWE-180, CWE-181). Make sure that your application does not

                libraries such as the OWASP ESAPI Canonicalization control. Consider performing repeated
                canonicalization until your input does not change any more. This will avoid double-decoding and
                similar scenarios, but it might inadvertently modify inputs that are allowed to contain properlyencoded dangerous content.

                some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the

                rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as

                syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input
                is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on looking for
                malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if
                the code`s environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended
                validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which
                inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When validating filenames, use
                stringent lists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single "." character
                in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such
                as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.
                Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters.
                This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering "/"
                is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a directory separator.
                Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces
                dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the ".../...//" string
                in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original string, but the
                remaining characters would still form the "../" string.</p>

                store them in a separate directory and use the web server`s access control capabilities to prevent

                each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the
                constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately. This significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms
                that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.

                may be obtained indirectly through API calls. Many file inclusion problems occur because the

                CWE-621, and similar issues. Often, programmers do not protect direct access to files intended
                only to be included by core programs. These include files may assume that critical variables have
                already been initialized by the calling program. As a result, the use of register_globals combined
                with the ability to directly access the include file may allow attackers to conduct file inclusion
                attacks. This remains an extremely common pattern as of 2009.</p>

                    conform to specifications, reject it or transform it into something that conforms. When performing
                    input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the

                    is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on looking for
                    malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if
                    the code`s environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended

                    constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, consider using the

                    <p>If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between
                    data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and
                    validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every
                    point where output is generated. For example, stored procedures can enforce database query
                    structure and reduce the likelihood of SQL injection.

                    <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                    <p>Understand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected.
                    This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when
                    generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or
                    multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations
                    to determine the required encoding strategies.</p>
                    <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                    <p>In some cases, input validation may be an important strategy when output encoding is not a
                    complete solution. For example, you may be providing the same output that will be processed
                    by multiple consumers that use different encodings or representations. In other cases, you may
                    be required to allow user-supplied input to contain control information, such as limited HTML
                    tags that support formatting in a wiki or bulletin board. When this type of requirement must be
                    met, use an extremely strict allowlist to limit which control sequences can be used. Verify that
                    the resulting syntactic structure is what you expect. Use your normal encoding methods for the
                    remainder of the input.</p>

                    <p>Use input validation as a defense-in-depth measure to reduce the likelihood of output encoding
                    errors (see CWE-20).</p>
                    <b>Phase: Requirements</b>
                    <p>Fully specify which encodings are required by components that will be communicating with each

                    the encoding you are using whenever the protocol allows you to do so.</p>',

                    <p>Strategy = Input Validation</p>
                    <p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use
                    a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not
                    strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing
                    input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the
                    full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related
                    fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be
                    syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input
                    is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on looking for
                    malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if
                    the code`s environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended
                    validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which
                    inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</p>

                    <p>Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that
                    is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an
                    encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either
                    by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which
                    can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might
                    treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original
                    encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks;
                    they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is
                    also being used by the downstream component.</p>

                    <p>Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application`s current internal representation
                    before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same
                    input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by
                    introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.</p>',

                    this weakness easier to avoid. For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such
                    as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the
                    programmer. Be wary that a language1s interface to native code may still be subject to overflows,
                    even if the language itself is theoretically safe.

                    <p>Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or
                    compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat
                    FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms
                    including canary-based detection and range/index checking. D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary
                    Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.

                    <p>Effectiveness = Defense in Depth</p>
                    <p>This is not necessarily a complete solution, since these mechanisms only detect certain types of
                    overflows. In addition, the result is still a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the
                    application.</p>
                    <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                    <p>Consider adhering to the following rules when allocating and managing an application`s memory:
                    Double check that the buffer is as large as specified. When using functions that accept a number
                    of bytes to copy, such as strncpy(), be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal to the
                    source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the string. Check buffer boundaries if accessing
                    the buffer in a loop and make sure there is no danger of writing past the allocated space. If
                    necessary, truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the copy and
                    concatenation functions.

                    <b>Phase: Operation</b>
                    <b>Phase: Build and Compilation</b>
                    <p>Strategy = Environment Hardening</p>
                    <p>Run or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions
                    of a program`s executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses
                    unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code. Examples
                    include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and PositionIndependent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their
                    default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as "rebasing" (for
                    Windows) and "prelinking" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR
                    for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the
                    libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking. For more information on these
                    techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].</p>
                    <p>Effectiveness = Defense in Depth</p>
                    <p>These techniques do not provide a complete solution. For instance, exploits frequently use a bug
                    that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337]. It
                    has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333]</p>
                    <b>Phase: Operation</b>
                    <p>Strategy = Environment Hardening</p>
                    <p>Use a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX
                    or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX
                    [REF-60] [REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a
                    memory address that is part of the code segment. For more information on these techniques see
                    D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].</p>
                    <p>Effectiveness = Defense in Depth</p>
                    <p>This is not a complete solution, since buffer overflows could be used to overwrite nearby
                    variables to modify the software`s state in dangerous ways. In addition, it cannot be used in
                    cases in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of
                    service, since the typical response is to exit the application.
                    </p>
                    <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                    <p>Replace unbounded copy functions with analogous functions that support length arguments,
                    such as strcpy with strncpy. Create these if they are not available.</p>
                    <p>Effectiveness = Moderate</p>
                    <p>This approach is still susceptible to calculation errors, including issues such as off-by-one errors
                    (CWE-193) and incorrectly calculating buffer lengths (CWE-131).

                    buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.',

                    <p>Strategy = Language Selection</p>
                    <p>Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make
                    this weakness easier to avoid. For example, many languages that perform their own memory
                    management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such
                    as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the
                    programmer. Be wary that a language`s interface to native code may still be subject to overflows,
                    even if the language itself is theoretically safe.</p>
                    <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                    <p>Strategy = Libraries or Frameworks</p>
                    <p>Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides
                    constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Examples include the Safe C String Library
                    (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56].
                    These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.</p>
                    <b>Phase: Operation</b>
                    <b>Phase: Build and Compilation</b>
                    <p>Strategy = Environment Hardening</p>
                    <p>Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or
                    compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat
                    FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms
                    including canary-based detection and range/index checking. D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary
                    Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.</p>
                    <p>Effectiveness = Defense in Depth</p>
                    <p>This is not necessarily a complete solution, since these mechanisms only detect certain types of
                    overflows. In addition, the result is still a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the
                    application.</p>
                    <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                    <p>Consider adhering to the following rules when allocating and managing an application`s memory:
                    Double check that your buffer is as large as you specify. When using functions that accept a
                    number of bytes to copy, such as strncpy(), be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal
                    to the source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the string. Check buffer boundaries if
                    accessing the buffer in a loop and make sure there is no danger of writing past the allocated
                    space. If necessary, truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the
                    copy and concatenation functions.</p>
                    <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                    <p>Strategy = Input Validation</p>
                    <p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use
                    a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not
                    strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing
                    input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the
                    full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related
                    fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input
                    is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on looking for
                    malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if
                    the code`s environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended
                    validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which
                    inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</p>
                    <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                    <p>For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are
                    duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side
                    checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to
                    remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the
                    server</p>
                    <b>Phase: Operation</b>
                    <b>Phase: Build and Compilation</b>
                    <p>Strategy = Environment Hardening</p>
                    <p>Run or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions
                    of a program`s executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses
                    unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code. Examples
                    include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and PositionIndependent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their
                    default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as "rebasing" (for
                    Windows) and "prelinking" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR
                    for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the
                    libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking. For more information on these
                    techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].</p>
                    <p>Effectiveness = Defense in Depth</p>
                    <p>These techniques do not provide a complete solution. For instance, exploits frequently use a bug
                    that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337]. It
                    has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333]</p>
                    <b>Phase: Operation</b>
                    <p>Strategy = Environment Hardening</p>
                    <p>Use a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX
                    or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX
                    [REF-60] [REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a
                    memory address that is part of the code segment. For more information on these techniques see
                    D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].
                    </p>
                    <p>Effectiveness = Defense in Depth</p>
                    <p>This is not a complete solution, since buffer overflows could be used to overwrite nearby
                    variables to modify the software`s state in dangerous ways. In addition, it cannot be used in
                    cases in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of
                    service, since the typical response is to exit the application.</p>
                    <b>Phase: Build and Compilation</b>
                    <b>Phase: Operation</b>
                    <p>Most mitigating technologies at the compiler or OS level to date address only a subset of buffer
                    overflow problems and rarely provide complete protection against even that subset. It is good
                    practice to implement strategies to increase the workload of an attacker, such as leaving the
                    attacker to guess an unknown value that changes every program execution.</p>
                    <b>Phase: Implementation</b>
                    <p>Replace unbounded copy functions with analogous functions that support length arguments,
                    such as strcpy with strncpy. Create these if they are not available.
                    </p>
                    <p>Effectiveness = Moderate</p>
                    <p>This approach is still susceptible to calculation errors, including issues such as off-by-one errors
                    (CWE-193) and incorrectly calculating buffer lengths (CWE-131).</p>
                    <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                    <p>Strategy = Enforcement by Conversion</p>
                    <p>When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a
                    mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs,
                    and reject all other inputs.</p>
                    <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                    <b>Phase: Operation</b>
                    <p>Strategy = Environment Hardening</p>
                    <p>Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks
                    [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a
                    single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the
                    rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as
                    the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.</p>
                    <b>Phase: Architecture and Design</b>
                    <b>Phase: Operation</b>
                    <p>Strategy = Sandbox or Jail</p>
                    <p>Run the code in a "jail" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between
                    the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed
                    in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software. OS-level examples
                    include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide
                    some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the
                    software to specify restrictions on file operations. This may not be a feasible solution, and it
                    only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to
                    compromise. Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.</p>
                    <p>Effectiveness = Limited</p>
                    <p>The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific
                    sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as
                    restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be
                    accessed.</p>',
